Finally I wrote in Russian right

Well, I finally did it.

But I think wins come in all sizes — big wins and small.

I feel good about my writing. It took me over a year to get good. I don’t really care how many people made fun of me for my writing (trust me, I know how horrible they look).

I’m a little slower than other people at learning a new language, but I’m happy that I kept going and figured out how to write.

Success came in the form of patience disguised as a piece of paper written in Russian.

What are you proud of? It doesn’t have to be that you became a master of the Swift language.

Is it spending time with your family after the new year holiday? Or studying a new language? Or preparing your favorite meal?

Let me know in a private message. I’m curious.
